# @px-ui/core

A modern React component library built with Tailwind CSS v4, TypeScript, and accessibility-first design principles.

## TypeScript

All components are written in TypeScript and include full type definitions.

## Accessibility

Components are built with accessibility in mind using [@base-ui/react](https://github.com/mui/base-ui) primitives, ensuring:

- Proper ARIA attributes
- Keyboard navigation
- Focus management
- Screen reader support
